# Enhanced Gold

Enhanced Gold is a Minecraft mod that expands and rebalances gold to make it more useful, interesting, and rewarding throughout the entire game. Instead of being a mostly niche resource, gold becomes a meaningful progression material with new uses, improved mechanics, and better integration into survival gameplay.

This mod is designed to feel *vanilla-friendly* while still giving gold a clear identity beyond trading with Piglins.

## 🎮 Gameplay Philosophy

Enhanced Gold focuses on **expansion, not replacement**.

* Gold remains fragile compared to higher-tier materials
* Benefits often come from utility, speed, or special effects rather than raw power
* The goal is to make gold *worth using*, not overpowered

If it feels like something Mojang *could* have added, then it fits the mod.

## 🧩 Compatibility

* Designed for modern Minecraft versions
* Works alongside most Fabric / Forge / NeoForge mods (depending on build)
* No known hard incompatibilities

> ⚠️ Mods that heavily overhaul materials, tools, or progression may affect balance.
